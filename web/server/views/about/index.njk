		<h1>About NICE Experience</h1>

		<p class="lead">
			NICE Experience is a set of reusable patterns, documentation and guidelines for rapid product development.
			<br/>Its goal is to create a consistent, acccessible digital experience across all of NICE's services.
		</p>

		<p>
			It's a source for creating beautiful, consistent experiences across NICE's digital services. It's aimed at developers, designers and content editors and consists of:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				A base framework to give the structure of a modern web app e.g. grid, typography etc
			</li>
			<li>
				A pattern library of both micro and macro patterns
			</li>
			<li>
				A style guide for both design and code
			</li>
			<li>
				A set of auto-generated documentation at a code-level for both SASS and JavaScript.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			 It is a re-work of NICE's original adaptation of Bootstrap, known as <a href="https://github.com/nhsevidence/NICE.Bootstrap" target="_blank" rel="external">NICE.Bootstrap</a>. This was

		<h2>Our aims and principles</h2>

		<ul class="grid">
			<li class="grid__item one-whole tablet--one-half desktop--one-third wide--one-quarter">
				<h3 class="h6">Tested and testable</h3>
				<p>
					JavaScript written in a testable way with unit tests. Responsive testing. Set of manual accessibility tests.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li class="grid__item one-whole tablet--one-half desktop--one-third wide--one-quarter">
				<h3 class="h6">Tooling doesnâ€™t in the way of the code</h3>
				<p>
					It's all about the code so using different IDEs or platforms for dev shouldn't get in the way of building things.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li class="grid__item one-whole tablet--one-half desktop--one-third wide--one-quarter">
				<h3 class="h6">Easy to maintain and extend</h3>
				<p>
					It should be a living thing that gets improved and extended so it's got to be easy for developers to pick up and work on.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li class="grid__item one-whole tablet--one-half desktop--one-third wide--one-quarter">
				<h3 class="h6">Easy to use and consume</h3>
				<p>
					It should be easy to integrate the NICE Experience into any application with just a few commands, for example via NPM, Bower, or Meteor's Atmosphere.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li class="grid__item one-whole tablet--one-half desktop--one-third wide--one-quarter">
				<h3 class="h6">Accessible</h3>
				<p>
					We aim to conform to <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/accessibility" target="_blank" rel="external">WCAG 2.0 Level AA</a> and follow the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/intro.html#introduction-fourprincs-head" target="_blank" rel="external">4 principles of accessibility</a> of perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for our content.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li class="grid__item one-whole tablet--one-half desktop--one-third wide--one-quarter">
				<h3 class="h6">Modern</h3>
				<p>
					But not just modern for the sake of being modern. There are some amazing modern web technologies that we use to try and make great experiences.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li class="grid__item one-whole tablet--one-half desktop--one-third wide--one-quarter">
				<h3 class="h6">Modular</h3>
				<p>
					You shouldn't be forced to include everything - pick and choose exactly what you need which means lightweight...
				</p>
			</li>
			<li class="grid__item one-whole tablet--one-half desktop--one-third wide--one-quarter">
				<h3 class="h6">Lightweight</h3>
				<p>
					It's not a monolithic framework with every design pattern NICE have ever used - it's lightweight 'starter for 10' that gives just enough of a framework and as a result is lightweight and quick loading.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Who is it for?</h2>

		<div class="grid">

			<div class="grid__item one-whole desktop--one-third">

					Either quickly rapidly prototype using a compiled version, or integrate it into your app and use it as a solid base.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a class="btn" href="/about/installation">Install</a>
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="grid__item one-whole desktop--one-third">

				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="grid__item one-whole desktop--one-third">
				<h3>Content editors</h3>
				<p>
					A set of guidelines for how components should be used and a set of templates. An up-to-date source of truth to ensure consistency of use across.
